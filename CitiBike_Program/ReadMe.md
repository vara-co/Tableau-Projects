<h2>Analysis and Conclusions (which you will also find in the visual story at Tableau)</h2><br/>

Introduction:
In this visual analysis, we will explore the activity for the Citi Bike program in the area of New Jersey. The Citi Bike program is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving different areas of New York City and New Jersey’s metro areas. It is the largest bike-sharing program in the US. The lead sponsor for this program is Citigroup, thus the inspiration for the name of the program. In 2018, the company was bought by Lyft, and currently uses Lyft technology. The program was first proposed in 2008 by the New York City Department of Transportation.

Goals:
The goal of this analysis is to discover any trends among the most active stations and possible reasons for them. We aim to identify the busiest hours for the top 10 stations, both at starting and ending points. Additionally, we seek insights regarding the type of ride being used and by what type of users, with a comparison between March 2023 and this year.

**Analysis**

• **Slide 2:** The maps in this analysis show the number of bikes at their starting point and at their ending point during the month of March 2024. This contributes to the discovery of which stations are more active than others within this timeframe. These visualizations also display the total number of trips during the entire month of analysis.

These maps help us better understand the reasons why the most active stations rank as they do. In this case, their location plays a significant role. Proximity to places of interest, such as restaurants, bars, businesses, banks, doctors, and access to the New York Metro Area via the Hoboken/NJ Transit Terminal, could contribute to the popularity of the most active stations, particularly the top two: Grove St. PATH and Hoboken Terminal - River St and Hudson Pl. This could be a strong reason why these stations are preferred by so many users.

• **Slide 3:** These visualizations displays the top 10 and bottom 10 stations in the New Jersey City Area for the month of March 2024. It is important to note that for this analysis, we are only considering stations that had more than 10 trips both at the starting and ending points. However, we also noted stations that had less than 10 trips to monitor their activity in future months. It might be important to consider removing these stations during a cost-effective analysis, perhaps by redistributing the bikes from those stations into more suitable areas. The Top 10 stations are displayed in blue, while the bottom 10 stations, each with more than 10 trips, are displayed in red.

In both the Maps and the Top 10 visualizations, the most popular stations appear to be Grove St. PATH and Hoboken Terminal - River St & Hudson Pl. These stations have, on average, almost twice as many trips as the next most active stations.

• **Slide 4:** The following visualizations display the activity of the top 10 stations per hour for the same month as this analysis. It shows that for the starting point, the most active hours occur between noon and 8 pm, with a few exceptions during other times of the day. This could be related to people leaving work or school during lunch hours, which may include part-time workers or students. The next surge of activity could be attributed to rush hour after office hours. Additionally, there are several restaurants and bars around the most active stations, suggesting that some Citi Bike program users might engage in shopping or dining before leaving the area for the day.

The visualization for the ending point shows a more dispersed result, with the most activity during rush hours both in the morning and afternoon, although there are some exceptions depending on the station and lunch hour.

• **Slide 5:** The last visualizations shows the number of users, either casual or members, and their preference for the type of bike. It was important to observe the changes from one year to another to better understand trends and provide a better service to current users.

It is important to note that in the comparison between March 2023 and March 2024, the following trends were observed:
Casual users that preferred classic bikes: 42.62% decrease
Members that preferred classic bikes: 34.90% decrease
Casual users that preferred electric bikes: 92.86% increase
Members that preferred electric bikes: 170.46% increase

With the above analysis, we can observe that the trend has changed drastically; in comparison to 2023, users now prefer electric bikes over classic bikes. Given that New Jersey is in a colder region of the country, March might still be quite cold for people to enjoy the outdoors, thus temperature could be a significant factor in bike preference.

It is important to note that casual users tend to prefer electric bikes over classic bikes. This preference could be due to factors such as being tourists or individuals who got tired of walking and decided to use an electric bike. On the other hand, members likely joined the program with the intention of staying fit and reducing the ecological impact of motor vehicles, making them more inclined to use classic bikes. However, this wasn't the trend for the month of March in the current year, as shown in the visualizations.

**Conclusions:**
1. There are actions to be taken to ensure the program's cost-effectiveness by removing stations with less than 10 trips per month. This will allow the program to trial other stations that might be better suited for the targeted user base.

2. Casual users tend to prefer electric bikes over classic bikes. However, members lean more towards using classic bikes than electric. Further analysis is needed to determine if the trend for members will continue indicating a transition to electric bikes, which had been the preference for March 2024.

3. The most active stations are crucial points in this analysis to discover other potential station locations that might be as attractive to users, particularly in areas where there are currently no stations. Understanding the patterns and factors contributing to the popularity of these stations can help in selecting introductory stations for areas lacking them.

4. Most trips happen during rush hours, suggesting that most users are either working or studying in the area. Conducting surveys among universities, educational institutions, and top businesses in the area can provide more insights about these users and help in creating a new market for those who have yet to join the program.
