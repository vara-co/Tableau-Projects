<h3 align="center">This Tableau Visualization was inspired by my DU Data Analytics & Visualization's Group Project 3.</h3><br/>

--------------------------------------
My Team and I worked on a project inspired by the recent 2024 Total Solar Eclipse passing across the USA and the duration per each of the locations in our dataset.<br/>
- You can find that project here:<br/> https://github.com/vara-co/solar-eclipse-2024
